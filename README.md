## Introduction

ArbNumerics exports three types: `ArbFloat`, `ArbBall`, `ArbComplex`.  `ArbFloat` is an extended precision floating point type. Math using `ArbFloat` is expected to be very near the veridical value, and often is the closest value for the precision in use. `ArbBall` is an interval-valued quantity formed of an `ArbFloat` (the midpoint) and a `radius`.  Math functions with `ArbBall` are assured to enclose the veridical value.  This assurance extends to multiple function applications.  `ArbComplex` is an `ArbBall` pair (real, imaginary).  The same enclosure assurance applies.

While the bounds of an `ArbBall` or `ArbComplex` are available, the default is to show these values as digit sequences which almost assuredly are accurate, in a round to nearest sense, to the precision displayed.  Math with `ArbFloat` does not provide the assurance one gets using `ArbBall`, as an `ArbFloat` is a point value.  While some effort has been taken to provide you with more reliable results from math with `ArbFloat` values than would be the case using the underlying library itself, `ArbBall` or `ArbComplex` are suggested for work that is important to you.  `ArbFloat` is appropriate when exactness is not required during development, or with applications that are approximating something at increasing precisions.

## Installation

This requires Julia v0.7-, and access to the Arb C library.  Do this (don't be concerned with the messages): `using Pkg; Pkg.rm("Nemo"); Pkg.rm("Nemo"); Pkg.add("Nemo")`. There will commence all sorts of activity.  If you are doing this before Nemo.jl has a v0.7 release, you will see a message that the  installation failed.  _That is OK!_  

Now you have the Arb C library and I can find it.

Restart Julia and do this: `using Pkg; Pkg.add("ArbNumerics"); Pkg.build("ArbNumerics"); using ArbNumerics`.

There should not be any error messages.  If there are, let me know.


## Constructors

Initially, the default precision is set to 106 bits.  All Arb types use the same default precision. You can change this to e.g. 750 bits: `setprecision(ArbFloat, 750)` or `setprecision(ArbBall, 750)`. While you may use whatever precision you like, the underlying C library is optimized for precisions <= 4_000 bits (roughly).

The precision in use may be set globally, as with BigFloats, or it may be given with the constructor.  For most purposes, you should work at one, two, or three precisions.  It is helps clarity to convert precisions explicitly, however, it is not necessary.

#### Constructors using the default precision

julia> b = ArbBall(pi)

julia> c = one(ArbComplex)

```

#### Constructors using a specified precision
```julia
julia> BITS = 53;

julia> a = sqrt(ArbFloat(2, BITS))
1.414213562373095

julia> b = ArbBall(pi, BITS)
3.141592653589793

julia> c = ArbComplex(a, b, BITS)
1.414213562373095 + 3.141592653589793im
```
```julia

julia> DIGITS == length(string(ans)) - 1 # (-1 for the decimal point)

## The Arb C library

- [Arb](https://arblib.org) is a C library for rigorous real and complex arithmetic with arbitrary precision.    
  Fredrik Johansson is Arb's designer and primary author., with contributions from others. 

- Arb tracks numerical errors automatically using the midpoint-radius representation of an interval.

- Arb is designed to provide evaluands that contain the veridical numerical result.
- Arb uses algorithms with provable error bounds foe multiprecision mathematical functions.

- The code is thread-safe, portable, and extensively tested. The library outperforms others.
